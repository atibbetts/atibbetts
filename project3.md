### Project #3
[Boston Transportation Equity Geospatial Study](/pdf/PPUA_7237_Final_PPT.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### Problem Statement

Boston is one of the worst cities for traffic in the nation. With traffic returning to pre-pandemic levels or worse and with the stress of unreliable transit, it seems tha something needs to be done to improve transit options especially for those who rely on it most. This research aim to understand which Boston Block Groups are the most vulnerable and the furthest from public transportation and could benefit most from additional transportion options such as subsidised self-driving taxi services.

### Urban Informatics Methods

In order to understand areas in Boston that are the most socially vulnerable I analyzed datasets for low-income households, unemployment rates, food insecurities in neighborhoods, minority populations, and education levels. The tools I used were ArcGIS Pro Exploratory Regression Report, Simple Suitability Model, Geometry Attributes, XY Table to Point, and Spatial Join.

### Urban Policy Implications

The goal of this study was to discover Boston's most vulnerable Block Groups that are furthest from subway stations using geospatial data and vulnerability metrics. It is difficult enough to be living in an expensive city without the proper means, but it is even more difficult to have to navigate Boston when subway stations are a longer walk. The summer and winter months can add to these issues. Designing pick-up and drop-off locations for self-diving vehicle technology in these neighborhoods can help improve transportation inequities and provide more opportunities to those who could use it most.
