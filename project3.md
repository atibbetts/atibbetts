a. The problem or question you addressed
    > Which Boston Block Groups are the most vulnerable and the furthest from public transportation which could benefit most from additional transportion options such as subsidised self-driving taxi services?

b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them
    > ArcGIS Pro Exploratory Regression Report, Simple Suitability Model, Geometry Attributes, XY Table to Point, and Spatial Join.

c. The urban policy and/or management implications
    > The goal of this study was to discover Boston's most vulnerable Block Groups that are furthest from subway stations using geospatial data and vulnerability metrics. It is difficult enough to be living in an expensive city without the proper means, but it is even more difficult to have to navigate Boston when subway stations are a longer walk. The summer and winter months can add to these issues. Designing pick-up and drop-off locations for self-diving vehicle technology in these neighborhoods can help improve transportation inequities and provide more opportunities to those who could use it most.
