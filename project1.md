[Boston MBTA Subway Reliability Presentation](/pdf/CIVE_7380_Final_PPT.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### Problem Statement

Some commuters are fortunate enough to be able to rely on personal vehicle ownership when service is disrupted. For many others, however, this option is unattainable. Having access to reliable modes of transportation, alternate to the subway, is a chronic resiliency issue for many Bostonians, but especially for the most vulnerable populations in the Boston area. This study aims to find if there is a relationship between the number of service alerts at each subway station and the demographics of the communities served.

### Urban Informatics Methods

Qualitative and quantitative data was taken from MBTA.com and the MBTA Open Data Portal. In order to understand the impacts of service disruptions, multiple datasets were used to understand frequency of service disruptions and possible correlating factors. The datasets analyzed were as follows:
1.	Service Alerts.
The service alert dataset includes system-wide data. The dataset includes detailed information about the alert, the severity, affected stations, and the general cause.
2.	Customer Satisfaction Survey.
This dataset contains the survey results to track customer satisfaction with the service, reliability, and communication of the MBTA.
3.	Passenger Demographic Survey.
The MBTA’s Rolling Rider Census represents the diversity of people who ride MBTA services and is an important tool in planning for bus, rail, and ferry services in the Greater Boston region. This data includes age, race, income, and vehicle ownership statistics and more.
4.	Station Entry Counts.
The count of gated station entries for any station with service by year from 2014 to the present year.
5.	Reliability.
This data is measured as the percentage of riders who waited less than or equal to the amount of time scheduled between trains.
6.	Travel Times.
This dataset contains the travel times between origin and destination pairs on a single line.
7.	Headways.
This dataset contains the headways, or time between departure of one train from a stop to the departure of the next train departing from that same stop, for rapid transit vehicles.
8.	Prediction Accuracy.
This dataset contains the prediction accuracy for subway and bus. Prediction accuracy is determined by the number of accurate predictions vs the number of total predictions for each "bin" or timeframe.

### Urban Policy Implications

The results of this analysis could be used to address disparities in the levels of service alerts at specific subway stations. Additionaly, the results can be used to better understand the severity of service alerts at different subway stations. This information can help the public understand which methods of transportation to prioritize during their daily commutes which can also impact other choices like where to live or if personal car ownership is a necessary option. Hopefully this information can also be used for planning and resource distribution for the MBTA.

In order to lessen the burden and reduce the number of service alerts, there are many steps that the MBTA are currently taking which will greatly improve reliability and system-wide resilience. 
+ Improved preventive maintenance: Prioritizing stations with higher ridership and vulnerable populations for proactive maintenance can help reduce unexpected service alerts.
+ Enhanced communication strategies: Providing clear, timely, and accessible information about service alerts can minimize the stress and disruption experienced by riders. This could include multilingual communication channels and real-time updates.
+ Investment in infrastructure: Investing in infrastructure upgrades and modernization at stations serving vulnerable populations can improve system reliability and reduce the likelihood of service disruptions.
+ Exploration of alternative transportation options: Investigating partnerships with ride-sharing services or offering subsidized taxi fares during service disruptions can provide vulnerable riders with alternative transportation options during emergencies.

New cars have been installed with more on the way, leadership is practicing transparency, communicating changes to the public in advance, and better allocating resources. Also, response teams are more organized, plans are in progress to maintain or upgrade track and remove speed restrictions, more digital signage is being installed, multiple media channels are used to communicate alerts, stations are being renovated, and the public’s opinion is being heard. In addition to the new MBTA CEO, Boston also has a new mayor, Massachusetts has a new governor, and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation has a new Secretary. All of these factors should lead to a more resilient subway system that works for all riders. By implementing these strategies, the MBTA can work towards minimizing the chronic stress of service alerts for its riders and enhancing the overall resiliency of the public transportation system for the diverse communities it serves.
