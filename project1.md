[Boston MBTA Subway Reliability Presentation](/pdf/CIVE_7380_Final_PPT.pdf){:target="_blank"}

a. The problem or question you addressed
    > Is there a relationship between the number of service alerts at each subway station and the demographics of the community served?

b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them
    > Data from MBTA's data portal was downloaded and processed using Python. Linear regression and correlation models were performed on a processed dataset using R. Visuals were created in ArcGIS Pro and Excel. 

c. The urban policy and/or management implications
    > The results of this analysis could be used to address disparities in the levels of service alerts at specific subway stations. Additionaly, the results can be used to better understand the severity of service alerts at different subway stations. This information can help the public understand which methods of transportation to prioritize during their daily commutes which can also impact other choices like where to live or if personal car ownership is a necessary option. Hopefully this information can also be used for planning and resource distribution for the MBTA.
