a. The problem or question you addressed
    > Is there a relationship between the wait times of certain 311 tickets and the demographics of different Boston Census Tracts?

b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them
    > Data from BARI's open data portal was downloaded and processed using R. Linear regression and correlation models were performed on the data using R. Visuals were created in ArcGIS Pro and R. 

c. The urban policy and/or management implications
    > The purpose of this analysis was to understand which 311 ticket types had longer wait times and of those ticket types, were there disparities in the wait times experiences across different census tracts. The results of this analysis can highlight some of the bigger problems faced in the city and where they are occuring. Some of the tickets called in to the 311 service are chronic issues. Understanding where these issues exist and which neighborhoods are affected most can inform decisions and resource allocation in the city to alleviate the issues and provide more equitable service.
