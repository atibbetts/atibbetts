## Project Features 

### Project #1

[Boston MBTA Subway Reliability Study](/pdf/CIVE_7380_Final_PPT.pdf)
<img src="images/service_alerts.png?raw=true"/>
a. The problem or question you addressed
    > Is there a relationship between the number of service alerts at each subway station and the demographics of the community served?

b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them
    > Data from MBTA's data portal was downloaded and processed using Python. Linear regression and correlation models were performed on a processed dataset using R. Visuals were created in ArcGIS Pro and Excel. 

c. The urban policy and/or management implications
    > The results of this analysis could be used to address disparities in the levels of service alerts at specific subway stations. Additionaly, the results can be used to better understand the severity of service alerts at different subway stations. This information can help the public understand which methods of transportation to prioritize during their daily commutes which can also impact other choices like where to live or if personal car ownership is a necessary option. Hopefully this information can also be used for planning and resource distribution for the MBTA.

### Project #2

[Boston 311 Level of Service Study](/pdf/PPUA_5262_Final_PPT.pdf)
<img src="images/wait_times.png?raw=true"/>
a. The problem or question you addressed
    > Is there a relationship between the wait times of certain 311 tickets and the demographics of different Boston Census Tracts?
b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them
    > Data from BARI's open data portal was downloaded and processed using R. Linear regression and correlation models were performed on the data using R. Visuals were created in ArcGIS Pro and R. 
c. The urban policy and/or management implications
    > The purpose of this analysis was to understand which 311 ticket types had longer wait times and of those ticket types, were there disparities in the wait times experiences across different census tracts. The results of this analysis can highlight some of the bigger problems faced in the city and where they are occuring. Some of the tickets called in to the 311 service are chronic issues. Understanding where these issues exist and which neighborhoods are affected most can inform decisions and resource allocation in the city to alleviate the issues and provide more equitable service.

### Project #3
[Boston Transportation Equity Geospatial Study](/pdf/PPUA_7237_Final_PPT.pdf)
<img src="images/ssm_output.png?raw=true"/>
a. The problem or question you addressed
    > Which Boston Block Groups are the most vulnerable and the furthest from public transportation which could benefit most from additional transportion options such as subsidised self-driving taxi services?
b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them
    > ArcGIS Pro Exploratory Regression Report, Simple Suitability Model, Geometry Attributes, XY Table to Point, and Spatial Join.
c. The urban policy and/or management implications
    > The goal of this study was to discover Boston's most vulnerable Block Groups that are furthest from subway stations using geospatial data and vulnerability metrics. It is difficult enough to be living in an expensive city without the proper means, but it is even more difficult to have to navigate Boston when subway stations are a longer walk. The summer and winter months can add to these issues. Designing pick-up and drop-off locations for self-diving vehicle technology in these neighborhoods can help improve transportation inequities and provide more opportunities to those who could use it most.
